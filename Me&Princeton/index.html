			<h1>My Commitment to Princeton!</h1>
			<p>My life’s goal is to make a positive impact, and I’m convinced that Princeton is the best place to create a tangible difference. Princeton’s interdisciplinary computer science department excites me, with the Center for Digital Humanities doing critical research in the intersection between identity and technology. The University's motto of “in the nation’s service and the service of humanity” inspires me every day. When I visited the campus months ago, watching students advocate on the steps of Mudd Hall, I knew there was nowhere else I would rather go.
