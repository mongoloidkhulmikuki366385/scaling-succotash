Today, I was asked to lead the National Chinese Honors Society induction! I was inducted last year, and my passion for langauges, including Urdu and Arabic, has only gre! My every free moment is spent gliding my calligraphy pen across free scraps of paper as I attempt to master the graceful strokes of Arabic and Chinese calligraphy, and I speak in Urdu, Arabic, and Chinese, almost as much as English!
